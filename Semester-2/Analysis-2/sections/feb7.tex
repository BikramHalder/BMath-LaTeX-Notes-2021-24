Note that the first theorem described in JDS's version of the notes for the lecture on February 7th is included in Theorem \ref{thm3:feb4}, Lecture 5 of this document, and is thus not reproduced here.

\begin{thm}
  If $B \subset \R$ is a bounded set, $\widehat{B} \coloneqq \{\abs{x-y} \colon x, y \in B \}$ is also bounded, and
  \[
    \sup\widehat{B} = \sup B - \inf B
  \]
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  There exists
